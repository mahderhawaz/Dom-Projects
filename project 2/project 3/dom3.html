            <div class="answer">
                We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If something isn’t right, we accept returns within 14 days of the delivery date. Items must be in new, unused condition, with original packaging, tags, and accessories (if applicable) still intact.

            <div class="question">How do I start a return or exchange?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                We recommend using trackable shipping to avoid lost packages. If you're returning due to a defect or a shipping error on our part, we will cover the shipping cost. Otherwise, you may be responsible for the return shipping fee, which will be deducted from your refund.<br><br>
                Exchanges are processed in the same way. Simply let us know in your email whether you'd prefer a refund or a replacement item.

            <div class="question">When will I receive my refund, and how will it be processed?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Once your return is received at our facility, we aim to process it within 5 to 7 business days. We’ll inspect the item to ensure it meets our return policy conditions. If everything is in order, we will issue your refund to the original payment method used at checkout (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
